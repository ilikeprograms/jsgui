	This library is based on work on the incomplete jsgui-client-webkit-ios. Within that library lots of development on data types and nested get/set, and that is being spun off into its
	own file. It can be tested separately better that way, and the codebase could become a lot clearer by removing it from that file and using a modular pattern. It would make a useful library
	and will be released as open-source for that purpose. Others may wish to develop it further. It will be a lot like backbone.js and will take cues from it in some ways. May have some or all
	of the backbone.js API.
