-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a side effect when the jsgui-lang-enh module is referenced: stringify() result changes. 
So, trying to run all the tests (using test.cmd command file) produces an error now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


crash\net_crash.js 
not sure if it's a test at all. I suppose to delete it.

document\test-document.js,
document\test-document2.js 
it seems to be a web-server. it starts, but it crashes when a page request occurs
(data-object.js line 108 throws an exception "stop Mini_Context typed id")
Delayed for the second pass.


jsgui-db\test-mongo-db.js 
db/resource-mongo.js not exists, but it exists in the big zip archive. Delayed for the second pass.

jsgui-html\test-abstract-controls.js
data-object.js Mini_Context class "init" function "type_id" inner function throws an exception immediately (line 108).
It looks like some TODO hook. Delayed for the second pass.

jsgui-lang/test-field-collection.spec.js
contains 2 tests, the second one is skipped because the jsgui.input_processors value seems depending of some side effect.
Delayed for the second pass.

jsgui-lang-essentials/test-async.spec.js 
Contains 2 tests, the first one is skipped - not sure yet how it must work properly.
Delayed for the second pass.

jsgui-node-images/test-jsgui-node-images.spec.js 
Contains 2 tests, the first one is skipped because it prints "Error decoding the input file" message to the console.
Delayed for the second pass.

jsgui-node-png/jsgui-node-png test-pixel-buffer.js:
jsgui_png.save_rgba_pixel_buffer_to_disk() method does not exists, jsgui_png.save_pixel_buffer_to_disk used instead.


jsgui-node-png/jsgui-node-png.spec.js:
"./source/pngsuite/f02n2c08.png" file read seems wrong (occurs for this file exactly). The test_load_pngs_to_rgba_buffer_save_as_png() test copies several files, but the only resulting file is wrong. I've added a separate test named "f02n2c08.png" to copy this file - it produces wrong result file too. Then I've tried to prepare the "test_load_png_with_scanline_filter_2" test, but it produces different output for the png.iterate_pixels() method. So, the PNG module seems unstable for now, and a detailed debug work is required. I've decided to skip all the jsgui-node-png.spec.js tests for now in order to complete the first "update existing tests" pass first.

jsgui-node-png/test-jsgui-node-png-reader-cpp.js:
The code seems not completed; delayed to the "detailed PNG code processing work" stage.

jsgui-node-render-svg: 
BTW the res_estimated differs from res

jsgui-node-sprite:
BTW the res_estimated differs from res
3rd test skipped, producing an error
1st test skipped, producing errors sometimes

jsgui-radio-button / test-jsgui-radio-button.spec.js 
(data-object.js line 108 throws an exception "stop Mini_Context typed id")
Delayed for the second pass.


jsgui-vector / test-jsgui-vector.spec.js 
a commentary in the source states that poly1.get('stroke') should return Stroke Data_Object,
but it returns string.
Delayed for the second pass.

native / fib.js 
seems unused and useless. I plan to delete it.

z_core/test_enhanced_data_object.spec.js
test_1 produces an error on line 89 (flags.remove)

z_core/test_data_object_collections.js 
"test_president_class" test (line 1118) produces an error: #<Class> has no method 'party'
Delayed for the second pass.

z_core/test_data_object_collections.js 
"test_collection_with_name_property" test (line 1483)
sets a name, but gets back an 'undefined', probably it's not correct
Delayed for the second pass.

Delayed for the second pass.

"test_indexed_array" test (line 750):
