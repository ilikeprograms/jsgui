// Want to get the core resources working and tested.
//  Want to run a clock website / service to start with.
//  The server could have a clock, while clients could connect to it and share the information.
//  Could also experiment with P2P distribution of the data.
//  A clock is also useful because it contains time signals so we can see how long it takes for data to reach various machines.


// A web resource in particular?
// Any need for an HTML resource?
//  Probably not - have web resource handle HTML and websockets.

// Resources could also have events which objects can listen to.
//  Programmatic objects can listen.
//  The resources may broadcast to whatever is listening.

// Also, maintaining one connection stream, communicating with multiple resources - could connect through a Resource Pool, or maybe there
//  could be a Multi Resource Publisher that publishes a bunch of resources.

// The Application router at the moment sending requests to resources.
//  I am thinking that rather than doing that, the requests should be handled by a resource publisher that interacts with the resource and publishes it over HTTP.

// Resources in general won't handle HTTP requests, though they will have the capability.
//  More likely that a resource, when it is served online, will be served using a Resource Publisher (which is itself a resource), which handles HTTP implementation details that would otherwise have
//  to be repeated between resources.
